        <h1>The Minimal Wardrobe Problem</h1>

        <p>
            How many articles of clothing do you actually need to avoid
            repeating an outfit for an entire year (365 days)?
        </p>

        <p>
            At first glance, this looks like a basic combinatorics problem.
            Shirts times pants times ties, done. But that answer feels a little
            too clean. It skips over what’s really happening when we “count
            outfits.” So instead of jumping straight to multiplication, let’s
            slow down and build the idea from the ground up.
        </p>

        <h2>The Usual Answer (and Why It Feels Incomplete)</h2>

        <p>An outfit consists of three articles of clothing:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Shirts</li>
            <li>Pants</li>
            <li>Ties</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            If you have <em>s</em> shirts, <em>p</em> pants, and
            <em>t</em> ties, then the total number of unique outfits is:
        </p>

        <p>
            <em>s × p × t</em>
        </p>

        <p>So something like 7 shirts, 7 pants, and 8 ties gives:</p>

        <p>
            <em>7 × 7 × 8 = 392</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            That clears the 365-day requirement. Problem solved. Except… this
            doesn’t explain <em>why</em> multiplication shows up here. It just
            assumes we’re comfortable with it.
        </p>

        <h2>Starting From Constraints</h2>

        <p>
            Instead of starting with “how many items do I own,” let’s start with
            restrictions.
        </p>

        <p>Suppose I can only change one article of clothing.</p>

        <p>
            If my shirt and pants are fixed, and the only thing I can change is
            my tie, then avoiding repeats for a year means I need 365 distinct
            ties. No combinatorics needed. Just brute force.
        </p>

        <p>Now loosen the constraint.</p>

        <p>
            Suppose I can change both my pants and my tie, but my shirt stays
            the same. Suddenly, I’m not just listing items anymore. I’m pairing
            choices.
        </p>

        <h2>What is Going Onnnnnnnnnn ?</h2>

        <p>Here’s where things usually get fuzzy.</p>

        <p>Say I own:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 shirts</li>
            <li>2 ties</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            People will say, “That’s 4 outfits.” Which is true. But notice what
            we’re <em>not</em> doing.
        </p>

        <p>
            We’re not choosing any two items from a pile of four. That would
            give combinations like two shirts or two ties, which isn’t an
            outfit. An outfit requires structure: one shirt <em>and</em> one
            tie.
        </p>

        <p>So what’s happening instead?</p>

        <p>For each shirt, I can pair it with every tie I own.</p>

        <p>
            That’s not “picking two things.” That’s making one choice from
            category A and one choice from category B.
        </p>

        <p>
            In probability terms, when two independent choices happen together,
            we multiply the number of options.
        </p>

        <p>So with 2 shirts and 2 ties:</p>

        <p>
            <em>2 × 2 = 4</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Lets Add some Denim</h2>

        <p>Now add pants.</p>

        <p>Each outfit is formed by making three independent selections:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>One shirt</li>
            <li>One pair of pants</li>
            <li>One tie</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Each choice doesn’t reduce the options for the others. That
            independence is the entire reason multiplication works here.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you want to describe this more formally, you can think of it as
            counting combinations across categories rather than combinations
            within a single set. That’s why binomial coefficients like
            <em>nC2</em> aren’t really the right tool here unless you force them
            into the problem.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Bother</h2>

        <p>
            Once you see outfits as structured selections rather than vague
            “combinations,” a lot of extensions become clearer:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>What happens if some items can be worn in multiple ways?</li>
            <li>What if outfits don’t always require all three pieces?</li>
            <li>
                What configuration minimizes the total number of items owned?
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Those questions aren’t about memorizing formulas. They’re about
            modeling the situation correctly first, then letting the math
            follow.
        </p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>

        <p>From here, you could:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Formally optimize the total item count</li>
            <li>Generalize to <em>n</em> clothing categories</li>
            <li>
                Add real-world constraints like laundry cycles or seasonality
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            None of this requires advanced math. It just requires being honest
            about what’s being counted.
