	<h1>An Introduction</h1>
	<p>This is my Personal Blog, I here discuss my projects, Art and Unique Problems in Math and Logic I find lying around. Aside from a Proof of Activity it also doubles as a Journal.</p>

	<h2>Projects</h2>

	<p>Here below is the list of my Projects which usually involve Programming, Experimenting with Machine Learning and Models I Build.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="/projects/project_1/project1.html">Tiny Compiler in Java</a></li>
		<li><a href="/projects/project2.html">Project Title 2</a></li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Problems</h2>

	<p>Here I list out problems in Math and Logic I stumble upon and find worth Mentioning. Work in progress</p>


	<h2>Art</h2>

	<p>Here I have Essays/Articles on pieces of Art which invoke Emotion in me. I have found what represents Art to me in the same sense Tolstoy defines it and I strongly also believe Art is the story to what we call History</p>

	<p>I have a long list of Artists and Art works I love and cherish. Here are a few names off the top of my head.
		I have a love for many mediums of Art including but not limited to Cinema(Recently in alot of Tarkovsky movies), TV, Books(Currently juggling Count zero by gibson and the Odyssey by Homer), Manga(Love whatever Kotteri, Nihei, Yamaguchi(Blue Period) have to offer of the recent), Anime(I recently watched Serial Experiment Lain and it is wild), Fine Art(Recently into the Works of MC Ecsher) and Music(into Metal and Daft Punk Lately).
