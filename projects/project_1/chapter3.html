  <h1>Chapter 3: Back to the pointy land</h1>

  <p>I feel as though now is a good time to say, by running in Java we got really lucky as the emitter is C as well and not directly assembly.</p>

  <p>Again to not have a barrage of errors and without an understanding of what we are doing, we will not follow the top down approach, instead we will start by building out the emitter class.</p>

  <p>We could try writing the emitter class in String but it would not be as efficient nor convenient (therein not analogous to Python too) as StringBuilder.</p>

  <p>My preference to Java and the love for it might just stem from here. It is a very consistent language, all functions are called the same way and it makes stuff predictable. There are still new and better things yet to learn for me with Java (like I didn’t know we had a <code>System.err.println</code> just a few days ago). Also, it's just more reader-friendly than Python.</p>

  <p>We go back to the Parser for a bit now and make some changes while removing all our print statements.</p>

  <p>We are basically just converting our language code to C code and if that feels like a cop out remember Java and Python were built like that.</p>

  <p>After making some changes to the Program class within Parser we will now go back and complete the main function for testing. As I write this code translating from Python into Java the Statements of C, It truly is as absurdly funny whilst being Spectacular. Humans were not meant for all this.</p>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We are using sets in our parsers which as I previously mentioned allows us to skip explicitly checking and to circumvent that while writing the LET function's emitter, Try this:</p>

  <p>The rest is very much just translation. With this we come to the end of making this Compiler in Java. Anyone Intrested to Try it can use the link below to access the code files on my github with a few Example code alongside it.</p>

  <p>I give my thanks to Austin Henley.</p>
