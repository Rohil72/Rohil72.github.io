	<title>Tiny Compiler in Java</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a 3-chapter journey of me making a compiler in Java. I took heavy inspiration from Austin Henley’s project of the same name, only difference being it was done in Python.</p>

<p>I highly recommend using his article if one wishes to make their own compiler. This article covers the minor nuances and differences in coding in Java and Python, and my commentary as I kept going.</p>

<p>I feel this project helped me understand a lot about the engine we call compilers and their complexity.</p>

<h2>Technical Disclosures</h2>

<p>We implement a language identical to Henley’s — a BASIC syntax language — and we compile our code into C.</p>
