	<title>Tiny Compiler in Java </title>

</head>
<body>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a 3 Chapter Journey of me making a Compiler in Java. I took heavy inspiration from Austin Henely's project of the same only difference being it was done in Python.</p>

<p>I highly Recommend using his article if one wishes to make their own Compiler. This article covers the minor Nuances and differences in Coding in Java and Python and me Commentary as I kept going.</p>

<p>I Feel this project made me understand alot about the Engine we call Compilers and thier Complexity.</p>

<h2>Technical Disclosures</h2>

<p>We here implement a Language identical to that of Henely's, i.e. A BASIC Syntax Language and we compile our code into C Language</p>
